I'm a developer interested in software architecture, reinforcement learning, games, and creating novel digital experiences. I'm highly experienced with Python and Java, and have a thorough working knowledge of JavaScript. I've also worked with languages and technologies like C(++), C#, Kotlin, React (Native), Flask, and the Unity Engine.
