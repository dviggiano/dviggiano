I'm a developer interested in software architecture, reinforcement learning, games, and creating novel digital experiences. I'm highly experienced with Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and have used Java extensively throughout my coursework. I've also worked with languages and technologies like C, C#, Kotlin, React (Native), Angular, Django, Flask, and the Unity Engine.
