I'm a software engineer and designer interested in reinforcement learning, software architecture, games, and building platforms that enable creativity and unique experiences. While I aspire to work in the industry as an application developer, I'm always looking to get involved in research, entrepreneurship, and other side projects. I'm also interested in AI alignment and interpretability.

I've used Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular in professional settings, and my university coursework has largely been based in Java. I've also worked with languages and technologies including C, C#, Kotlin, React (Native), Django, Flask, Firebase, and the Unity Engine.
