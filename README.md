I'm a developer and designer interested in software architecture, reinforcement learning, games, and engineering platforms for creativity and novel experiences. I've used Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular in professional settings, and my university coursework has largely been based in Java. I've also worked with languages and technologies like C, C#, Kotlin, React (Native), Django, Flask, Firebase, and the Unity Engine.
