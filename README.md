I'm a software engineer and designer interested in reinforcement learning, software architecture, games, and building platforms that enable creativity and unique experiences. While I primarily aspire to work in the industry as a developer for desktop and mobile applications, I'm always looking to get involved in research, entrepreneurship, and other side projects.

I've used Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular in professional settings, and my university coursework has largely been based in Java. I've also worked with languages and technologies including C, C#, Kotlin, React (Native), Django, Flask, Firebase, and the Unity Engine.
